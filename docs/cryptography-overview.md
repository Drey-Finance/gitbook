# Cryptography Overview

## Cryptography and Communications

Drey Actuaries (miners) utilize different cryptographic technology and communications protocols together to create robust methods for securing the network, validating and processing proof of life claims, issuing DREY tokens and all actuarial operations, including voting, wallet operations and distribution calculations.

#### nostr Protocol <a href="#nostr-protocol" id="nostr-protocol"></a>

Drey Actuaries (miners) coordinate operations over the [nostr protocol](https://nostr.com/), with each Drey Actuary running their own private [relay](https://nostr.com/relays). Nostr was selected because of the client / relay architecture and eventual private [asynchronous communication](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-nostr-can-improve-bitcoin-privacy). Drey Actuaries operating their own private relays can tune their relays to accept messages from other Drey Actuaries as the medium for conducting communications for actuary operations, co-ordination on voting, cryptographic threshold signature and verifiable random function protocols, as well as in future accepting communications from other clients that Drey Actuaries may offer services to that are not yet in view.

#### ROAST Protocol <a href="#roast-protocol" id="roast-protocol"></a>

Drey Actuaries will undertake operations to act Schnorr signature co-signers using the [ROAST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550) variant of the [FROST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852) signature scheme. FROST ([Flexible Round Optimized Schnorr Threshold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf)) is a powerful new kind of multisig that aggregates the key shares of federation members into a joint FROST key. To spend under this key, a threshold number of members must each produce a signature share. The shares are then combined to form a single signature that is valid under the joint FROST key. Members coordinate off chain over the nostr protocol. FROST transactions are indistinguishable from regular single-party Taproot spends. ROAST is a wrapper on top of FROST. From the research paper, "ROAST is a simple wrapper that turns a given threshold signature scheme into a scheme with a robust and asynchronous signing protocol, as long as the underlying signing protocol is semi-interactive (i.e., has one preprocessing round and one actual signing round), provides identifiable aborts, and is unforgeable under concurrent signing sessions. When applied to the state-of-the-art Schnorr threshold signature scheme FROST, which fulfils these requirements, we obtain a simple, efficient, and highly practical Schnorr threshold signature scheme."

Drey's intention is to utilize the nostr protocol to structure communications for the ROAST protocol's wrapper protocol that runs ùë° FROST sessions concurrently, one session for each subset of ùë° signers.

A prototype open source implementation of ROAST in Rust is [here.](https://github.com/nickfarrow/roast/tree/b7f64d7a70a421d6a5bfb10ccb765b091e8c0ca3)

#### Distributed Trust Authority <a href="#distributed-trust-authority" id="distributed-trust-authority"></a>

Drey Actuaries will act as [Distributed Trust Authorities](https://milagro.apache.org/docs/milagro-design), acting on requests from the Drey Proof of Life app to issue shares of a [Type-3 identity based private key](https://milagro.apache.org/docs/milagro-crypto) to randomised identities enrolling in the fund. See the figure below for Level 1 C4 diagram of the services in play.

Drey Actuaries respond to a cryptographically secured request from the Drey Proof of Life App to generate a share of this identity based private key and encrypt it with a public key generated in the Drey Proof of Life App operated by the Drey Investor. The public key encryption is necessary to secure the share so that no party, including any intermediary relay, can obtain access to the share. Drey Actuaries will also provide shares of a server secret to each other Drey Actuary so individually each will be enabled to run the [M-Pin zero-knowledge proof multi-factor identity verification protocol ](https://milagro.apache.org/docs/milagro-protocols)with the Drey Investors during the Proof of Life operation every month. Note the Drey Actuaries do not need to co-ordinate with each other to issue shares, a DTA simply responds to the request from the Drey Proof of Life App or other Drey Actuaries for a share.

**About M-Pin**

M-Pin is a multi-factor authentication protocol developed by [Apache Milagro](https://milagro.apache.org/docs/milagro-intro) that provides strong security and user privacy while minimizing reliance on traditional password-based systems. It leverages pairing-based cryptography and the Distributed Trust Authority (DTA) concept to achieve its goals.

1. Secure: M-Pin is designed to provide secure user authentication without relying on passwords, which are often vulnerable to attacks, such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force. Instead, it uses cryptographic keys and tokens to authenticate users, providing better security and privacy.
2. Multi-factor Authentication: M-Pin allows for multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring users to present multiple pieces of evidence (factors) to prove their identity. These factors can include something the user knows (e.g., a PIN), something the user has (e.g., a cryptographic token), and something the user is (e.g., biometrics). This increases security by making it more challenging for an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
3. Pairing-Based Cryptography: M-Pin utilizes pairing-based cryptography to enable secure and efficient cryptographic operations. This allows for the construction of cryptographic primitives, such as zero-knowledge proofs, which provide strong security guarantees without revealing sensitive user information.
4. Distributed Trust Authority: M-Pin leverages Apache Milagro's DTA to decentralize trust and improve security. By distributing the responsibility of signing and validating cryptographic keys among multiple independent nodes (Decentralized Trust Authorities, or DTAs), the system becomes more resilient against attacks and failures.
5. Privacy: M-Pin ensures user privacy through zero-knowledge proof techniques, which allow users to prove their identity without revealing sensitive identifying information. In addition, the DTA model helps protect user privacy by preventing any single entity from having full control over the system.
6. Use Cases: M-Pin can be employed in various applications requiring secure user authentication, such as online services, financial transactions, and access control systems.

### Distributed Verifiable Random Function

Drey Actuaries will co-ordinate over nostr a _Distributed Verifiable Random Function_ which is a particular case of [secure multiparty computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure\_multi-party\_computation) that allows a set of mutually distrustful servers to initialize and compute a [Verifiable Random Function](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05) _fsk(x)_ for strings _x_, with no trusted central party. A Verifiable Random Function can be seen as the public-key cryptography version of a keyed cryptographic hash. A prominent application for such protocols is in PoS-based consensus in distributed ledgers which require a reliable, unpredictable and unbiased source of entropy or [Decentralized](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/) [Random Beacon](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons) (DRB) to select block producers.

This DVRF protocol will enable Drey Actuaries to randomly and securely select the Drey Miner who will propose monthly distribution schedules and payouts.
