# AI Powered Fund Administration

Designing the Drey Network to incorporate both the benefits of full decentralization of Drey Actuaries and the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) requires a careful balance between human oversight and automated processes. Our proposed architecture is described below:

**Blockchain Infrastructure and Smart Contracts**: The foundation of the Drey Network is a blockchain infrastructure, which provides the benefits of decentralization, transparency, and security. Smart contracts will be used to automate the operations of the fund administration, including the allocation and adjustment of Dreybits. These smart contracts would be publicly auditable, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.

**Decentralized Actuaries**: The Drey Actuaries would be a decentralized network of individuals or entities that oversee the operations of the fund administration. They would be responsible for verifying the accuracy of the smart contracts and the fairness of the Dreybits allocations. The actuaries also play a role in governance, voting on changes to the system and resolving any&#x20;

**Integration of AI**: AI will be integrated into the system to automate and optimize certain processes. For example, AI could be used to predict mortality rates, which would inform the initial allocation of Dreybits. AI could also be used to dynamically adjust Dreybits allocations as participants pass away, ensuring fairness and optimizing payouts for the remaining participants. The AI system would operate within the parameters set by the smart contracts, ensuring that it cannot make changes that violate the rules of the fund administration bylaws.

**Hybrid Decentralized AI**: To preserve the benefits of decentralization while incorporating AI, a hybrid decentralized AI model will be used. In this model, the AI system would be decentralized across the network, with each actuary running a node of the AI system, with many different LLMs employed on the back end. This would ensure that no single entity controls the AI system, preserving the decentralization of the network. Each nodes AI system will be trained and updated collectively by the actuaries, ensuring that it continues to improve over time.

**Privacy and Security**: Privacy and security are key considerations in the design of the Drey Network. The blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts will provide a high level of security, while the use of zero-knowledge proofs will protect the privacy of participants. The AI system will be designed with privacy in mind, ensuring that it does not have access to sensitive personal data. Regular audits and security reviews will ensure the ongoing security and privacy of the system.

This architecture enables the Drey Network to incorporate the benefits of full decentralization and the capabilities of AI, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient Drey fund administration system.
