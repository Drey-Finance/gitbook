# Incentives and Disincentives

In the Drey Finance ecosystem, various incentives and disincentives have been established to modulate stakeholder behavior and coordinate their actions. Here is a list of incentives and disincentives for the major stakeholders:

**Incentives:**

1. **Drey Fund Investors:**
   * Monthly airdrops of DREY tokens in addition to Bitcoin remuneration.
   * Potential to earn additional yield through participation in Drey Save (BTC/DREY liquidity pool).
2. **Drey Miners:**
   * Revenue share from the Drey Protocol's Bitcoin revenue flow based on their pro-rata percentage of DREY token holdings.
   * Increased revenue share as they stake more DREY tokens and run continuous mining operations.
3. **Liquidity Providers in Drey Save:**
   * Earning trading fees from the DREY/BTC Automated Market Maker.
   * Additional yield farming rewards for providing liquidity.

**Disincentives:**

1. **Drey Fund Investors:**
   * Opportunity cost of not participating in Drey Save, which provides additional yield through trading fees and yield farming.
2. **Drey Miners:**
   * Forgoing revenue share if they don't stake DREY tokens and run continuous mining operations.
   * Potential loss of staked Bitcoin and DREY tokens if they provide faulty work or attempt to attack the network (assuming a slashing mechanism is in place).
3. **Liquidity Providers in Drey Save:**
   * Impermanent loss risk due to price fluctuations of DREY and BTC in the liquidity pool.

These incentives and disincentives help align the interests of the different stakeholders, ensuring that they work together to maintain and grow the Drey Finance ecosystem in a decentralized manner. The system encourages positive behavior while punishing negative actions or lack of participation, facilitating coordination among stakeholders even without formal contracts or centralized control.
