# About Tontines

[Tontines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tontine), a financial product with a rich history dating back to the 17th century, have recently been the subject of [much academic research](https://www.brookings.edu/research/retirement-tontines-using-a-classical-finance-mechanism-as-an-alternative-source-of-retirement-income/) due to their unique structure and potential benefits. Named after Lorenzo de Tonti, who popularized the concept in France, tontines pool the funds of participants and distribute the returns among the surviving members. This structure provides a lifetime income for participants and can potentially offer higher returns compared to other types of retirement savings plans.

The resurgence of interest in tontines is largely due to the growing public pension funding gap, projected to reach $400 trillion by 2050. Traditional annuities and pensions, with their low interest rates, inflationary fiat payments, and opaque solvency issues, are increasingly seen as inadequate for addressing this gap. Tontines, with their inherent longevity risk pooling and potential for higher returns, offer a promising alternative.

Administering tontines on the blockchain is a revolutionary idea that brings numerous benefits. Blockchain's transparency, security, and immutability make it an ideal platform for tontines. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making the operations of the tontine transparent and auditable. This eliminates the potential for manipulation or fraud, a problem that has plagued traditional tontines.

Moreover, blockchain enables the decentralization of tontine administration, further reducing the potential for abuse. In a decentralized tontine, no single entity has control over the funds or the allocation of payouts. Instead, these tasks are governed by smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This ensures that the rules of the tontine are followed faithfully, enhancing trust and participation.

Drey Finance leverages the power of blockchain to offer a modern, transparent, and secure tontine. By combining the pooling of mortality-based life credits with the growth and income potential of digital assets, Drey Finance delivers stable high income returns with low risk. The integration of artificial intelligence into Drey Finance's operations further enhances efficiency, accuracy, and user experience, making Drey Finance's tontine a truly innovative solution for the 21st century.

In conclusion, tontines, when administered on the blockchain, offer a promising solution to the public pension funding gap. They provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way to generate a lifetime income, making them an attractive option for individuals, couples, and families seeking financial security in retirement. With its blockchain-based tontine, Drey Finance is at the forefront of this financial revolution, ready to redefine income and retirement in the digital age.
