# Protocol Costs

To create an effective token distribution plan, it's important to allocate tokens for various purposes within the ecosystem. Here's an initial list of "budget items" that may require a dedicated pool of tokens in a typical tokenomic model:

1. Team and Founders: Allocate tokens to the core team and founders to align their interests with the long-term success of the project. These tokens are typically subject to vesting schedules to ensure ongoing commitment.
2. Investors and Advisors: Set aside tokens for early investors, strategic partners, and advisors. These allocations can also have vesting schedules to ensure long-term alignment with the project's success.
3. Drey Miners: Allocate a portion of tokens for Drey Miners who contribute to the ecosystem by staking Bitcoin and providing liquidity. This allocation can be used to incentivize their continued participation in the network.
4. Drey Fund Investors: Reserve tokens for Drey Fund investors to be distributed via airdrops in conjunction with their monthly Bitcoin remunerations.
5. Ecosystem Growth and User Incentives: Dedicate a portion of tokens for user incentives, such as staking rewards, yield farming, liquidity provision, and referral programs. This allocation helps drive user engagement and platform adoption.
6. Community Airdrops and Grants: Set aside tokens for community airdrops, grants, and other initiatives to encourage wider participation and foster a strong community.
7. Governance and Treasury: Allocate tokens to the project's governance system and treasury, enabling token holders to participate in decision-making processes and fund future developments or initiatives.
8. Marketing and Partnerships: Reserve a portion of tokens for marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, and business development to expand the project's reach and attract new users.
9. Reserve and Contingency: Maintain a reserve of tokens for unforeseen circumstances or future requirements, such as protocol upgrades, security measures, or additional incentives.
10. Token Sales: Allocate a portion of tokens for initial public sales, private sales, or other fundraising mechanisms to raise capital and distribute tokens to a wider audience.

By budgeting the initial token supply and any ongoing flows from inflation or buybacks across these categories, you can ensure a balanced distribution that supports the growth and development of the ecosystem while aligning the interests of various stakeholders.
