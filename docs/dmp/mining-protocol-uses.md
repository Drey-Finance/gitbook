# Mining Protocol Uses

## On-boarding

Each new investor in Drey will be given a P2TR MultiSig with HTLC wallet address under control of the Drey mining pool. This is not the Drey Vault but an interim on-boarding wallet address that requires a super majority (67%) to sign the transaction else it will be returned to the user. This is a stop gap measure to insure the Drey Proof of Life/KYC service approves the transaction as well, providing safeguards that non-KYCd funds do not contaminate the Drey Vault containing the bitcoin.

If the transaction is agreed to by the Drey Miners and KYCd service the funds, once confirmed in the on-boarding wallet, will be swept into the Drey BTC Vault. This wallet is a FROST enabled P2TR address under control of the miners solely.

## Stacks Mining and Stacking

Drey Financial will operate the hardware and network infrastructure that the Drey Miners will utilize to perform Stacks mining with the deposited BTC. It is existential that Drey Financial not be able to control over and above any miners under its control the entire mining pool. For this reason, the decentralized mining protocol is critical.&#x20;

The Drey Miners will operate on behalf of the Drey fund investors wallets that enable Stacks mining (BTC Vault) and stacking (Stacks Vault), and will, on a monthly basis, distribute rewards (minus Drey administration fees) to Drey fund investors.

Additionally, Drey Miners will also operate the BTC Vault to re-distribute BTC re-allocated from deceased members in the fund to the surviving members in the fund once a month, to either their personal address outside the fund, or another BTC address associated with an AMM liquidity pool on Stacks blockchain.

## AMM Liquidity Pools

Drey Miners will also deposit funds into and manage AMM liquidity pools on behalf of specific individual investors who opt to have the bitcoin survivor yields and DREY airdrops redeposited into AMMs on Stacks blockchain for additional yield.
