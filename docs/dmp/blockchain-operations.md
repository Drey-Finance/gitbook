# Blockchain Operations

## Bitcoin and Stacks

Drey Miners will read and write to both the bitcoin blockchain and Stacks blockchain. Drey Miners will incorporate [Chainhooks](https://www.hiro.so/blog/meet-4-new-features-in-clarinet?ref=stacksblog). Chainhooks enable automatically triggered actions based upon a predicate event occurring. Adhering to an event-based architecture, chainhooks allow a developer to pre-determine an underlying set of events that, when triggered, set into motion a logical series of follow-on steps and actions to address the specific event that was triggered. Chainhooks can target both Stacks and Bitcoin. Chainhooks are possible thanks to a new Event Observer layer designed for Bitcoin and Stacks that considers the Bitcoin chain as a first class citizen.

Drey Miners will observe and respond to events on both bitcoin and Stacks using chainhooks.
