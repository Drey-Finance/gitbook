# Incentives and Disincentives

How can we coordinate the different (often anonymous) stakeholders if we don’t have contracts or any sort of formal control like we would in a corporation? Carrots and sticks, is the answer. Incentives and disincentives are created through the utility mechanisms, and modulate the behavior of the different stakeholders by rewarding and punishing certain actions. The first example of such a crypto-economic system was Bitcoin, where miners are rewarded with BTC for correctly running the consensus (incentives) and forgo that revenue when they are on the wrong chain (disincentives). Since Bitcoin, we have seen a huge proliferation of similar mechanisms to coordinate a range of different stakeholders. A common pattern is to require collateral in the native token for the right to provide work of different kinds. If the work is done correctly, rewards are earned. In the case of faulty work or even an attack on the network, the collateral can be confiscated (“slashed”). It is important to consider incentives and disincentives for all major stakeholders, and systematically thinking through this helps to fine tune the mechanisms used. &#x20;
