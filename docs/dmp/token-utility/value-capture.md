# Value Capture

If the token is used to capitalize the network by using it as an instrument for fundraising (whether from private investors or with a public sale), to determine ownership, and to set long-term incentives for key stakeholders including the team, it needs to capture value. Value capture answers the question “If this project is successful, why would the token be valuable?”. The market price of a token is always determined by the supply and demand at any given time. As a result, a token that captures value needs to create sustainable demand for the token, e.g. because it is needed to use the network or clear benefits can be unlocked by being a token holder. Properties of the supply dynamics are at the heart of this section, for instance whether there is a fixed, inflationary or even deflationary supply of the token. For instance, mechanisms adapted from traditional finance that rely on programmatically buying back of tokens, either for redistribution (“buyback-and-make”) or permanently removing them from supply (“buyback-and-burn”) provide different ways of value capture. Additionally, mechanisms like staking that remove circulating supply while giving out continuous rewards to stakers indirectly support the value capture of a token.
