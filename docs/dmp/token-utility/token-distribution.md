# Token Distribution

Token distribution concerns how the supply of the token is split up and distributed. This includes the release schedules (vesting) for investors and the team, where 2-5 years of locked up tokens have become standard to ensure alignment. Token distribution also concerns the mechanisms with which the token is launched initially, as well as distributed over time. For launching a token, a wide range of mechanisms is available: airdrops to early users, pre-sales to private investors, public sales with different pricing mechanisms (simple priced sales, vs. auctions or liquidity bootstrapping pools), or direct listings on exchanges. When it comes to distribution over time, projects can either choose to distribute tokens to their users either initially (e.g. conditional airdrops or temporary reward campaigns) or continuously (based on usage numbers).
