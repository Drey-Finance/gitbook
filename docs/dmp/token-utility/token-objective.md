# Token Objective

The token objective can be derived from considering both the overall network objective conducted in the token discovery phase, as well as the incentives/disincentives section prior to it in the Token Utility Canvas. The token objective often includes the coordination of the different stakeholders to produce value as a network, whether that happens on the infrastructure or application layer. On top of that, the native token is also frequently used to govern the protocol in a decentralized manner. Governance is usually conducted under the umbrella of a DAO that allows token holders to come to agreement on the mechanisms and parameters used, manage the treasury, and decide on the future of the protocol. At Outlier Ventures, we have a different process to structure governance: there are workshops and tools specifically focused on that topic, and a governance specialist that supports teams for which it is a priority.
