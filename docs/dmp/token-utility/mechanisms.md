# Mechanisms

Mechanisms describe how the different stakeholders use the token to interact with one another and with the core product/protocol. Examples include using the token as a means of payment or a representation of a certain resource or as a commitment or collateral (e.g. different staking or locking mechanisms). The token may also be used for different signaling modalities (e.g. curation or governance), or for the right to provide work. The mechanisms are quite different from one project to another and will depend on the overall network objectives, as well as the value exchange between different stakeholders. What they all have in common is that the token mechanisms provide the means for the stakeholders to coordinate in a decentralized manner. When filling out the canvas for the first time, we encourage teams to list different ideas and then help refine them in discussion with our token design experts.
