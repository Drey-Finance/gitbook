# Token Journey

This section of the Token Utility Canvas helps teams think through how the most important stakeholders would acquire and then use tokens. Ideally, teams would consider the full journey those stakeholders will go through, which helps identify potential points of friction. For example, a user could earn their token through user rewards or an airdrop, or need to first acquire it before being able to use the protocol. Sometimes, the token is not required for basic users but unlocks more advanced forms of participation. While some stakeholders will only go through a part of that journey and then drop off, others will get more involved over time (e.g. take on other roles, participate in governance, etc.). As a result, the token journey can also be thought of as a funnel with different conversion and churn rates between the different levels of engagement. Often, distinguishing the token journey between demand and supply side makes sense, but this depends on the specifics of a project (sometimes, this distinction is discarded altogether or replaced with a more suitable one).
