# Stakeholders

The DREY token, through its utility in mining, staking, and liquidity provision, will create a dynamic ecosystem with incentives for different stakeholders to participate and exchange value. The economics of Drey Finance is designed to ensure a fair distribution of tokens, while enabling the growth and sustainability of the protocol.

1. **Drey Fund Investors**: These are the individuals who deposit funds into the Drey platform to receive trustless Bitcoin income streams and DREY token airdrops. They are the primary beneficiaries of the ecosystem.
2. **Drey Miners**: They are responsible for staking bitcoin and DREY tokens to run mining operations and maintain the Drey Protocol. Drey Miners are essential for the security and stability of the ecosystem and are rewarded with a share of the Drey Protocol's revenue.
3. **Drey Liquidity Providers**: These stakeholders provide liquidity to the DREY/BTC two-sided Automated Market Maker (AMM) on the platform, allowing for smooth token exchange between users. In return, they receive trading fees and can participate in yield farming.
4. **Third-Party Protocols**: These include users of protocols like [Zest Protocol](https://www.zestprotocol.com/) or [Alex Protocol](https://alexgo.io/), where Drey Finance may deposit its Bitcoin reserves to increase investment yield for the benefit of all stakeholders.
5. **Drey Finance Corp.**: The organization responsible for running the Drey Proof of Life app and service, managing the platform, and ensuring its smooth operation.
6. **Community at large**: This includes everyone who participates in the ecosystem, such as developers, marketers, advocates, and other supporters who contribute to the growth and success of Drey Finance.
