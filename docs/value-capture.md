# Value Capture

The DREY token captures value in several ways, beginning with its role as a fundraising instrument for the Drey Finance ecosystem. By offering the token to private investors or through a public sale, the network can capitalize its operations and build the infrastructure necessary for its success. The token's value is intrinsically linked to the growth and success of the Drey Finance platform, as increased demand for its services and products would subsequently increase the demand for DREY tokens.

As the Drey Finance ecosystem expands, the DREY token's utility as a means of accessing investment opportunities, participating in the Drey actuarial operations, and yield farming creates sustainable demand. The more the platform is utilised, the higher the demand for DREY tokens, as users require them to access and benefit from the platform's services. This demand is further supported by the network's governance aspect, as token holders have the incentive to acquire and hold DREY tokens to influence the platform's direction and future developments.

Supply dynamics also play a significant role in the DREY token's value capture. Depending on the project's design, the token may have a fixed, inflationary, or deflationary supply. In the case of a deflationary supply, value capture may be enhanced through mechanisms such as buybacks and burns, which reduce the total supply of tokens and create upward pressure on the token's price. Alternatively, an inflationary supply with continuous rewards for stakers can support value capture by incentivising users to hold and stake their tokens, effectively reducing the circulating supply.

Staking is another critical component of the DREY token's value capture strategy. By allowing users to stake their tokens with Drey Actuaries and earn bitcoin rewards, the circulating supply of DREY tokens is reduced, leading to scarcity and potential price appreciation. This mechanism not only supports the token's value but also strengthens the network by encouraging long-term commitment from its stakeholders.

In summary, the DREY token captures value through a combination of fundraising, utility, governance, supply dynamics, and staking mechanisms. By creating sustainable demand for the token and offering clear benefits for token holders, the DREY token's value is intrinsically linked to the success and growth of the Drey Finance ecosystem. These value capture mechanisms work together to ensure that the token remains valuable and serves as an essential component of the platform's long-term success.
