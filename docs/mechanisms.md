# Mechanisms

In the Drey Finance ecosystem, the token mechanisms enable decentralized coordination and value exchange among stakeholders. The core token in this ecosystem is the DREY token. Here are the key mechanisms through which the different stakeholders interact with the DREY token and the core product/protocol:

1. **Monthly Airdrops**: Drey Fund Investors receive monthly airdrops of DREY tokens, which are pari passu with their Bitcoin monthly remunerations. This incentivizes investors to deposit funds into the Drey platform.
2. **Staking for Drey Miners**: Drey Miners stake Bitcoin and DREY tokens to run mining operations and maintain the Drey Protocol. The more DREY tokens a miner can stake, the larger the percentage of the Drey Protocol revenue they will be entitled to.
3. **Revenue Share for Drey Miners**: Drey Miners receive a share of the Drey Protocol's Bitcoin revenue flow based on a pro-rata percentage of their DREY token holdings. Only Drey Miners who stake DREY tokens and run continuous mining operations are eligible for this revenue share.
4. **Drey Save**: Drey Fund Investors have the option to deposit their monthly DREY token airdrops and Bitcoin remittances into Drey Save, which is a two-sided liquidity pool (BTC/DREY) managed by the Alex Automated Market Maker Protocol. By participating in Drey Save, investors become liquidity providers and obtain additional yield through trading fees and yield farming.
5. **DREY/BTC Automated Market Maker**: The DREY token can be exchanged for Bitcoin using the DREY/BTC Automated Market Maker (AMM). This mechanism ensures liquidity for the DREY token and allows Drey Miners to obtain more DREY tokens to increase their stake and revenue share. It also enables DREY token holders to sell their tokens for Bitcoin if they wish to do so.
6. **Governance**: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, DREY tokens may potentially be used for governance purposes, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes, such as protocol upgrades or changes to the fee structure.

These mechanisms collectively provide a decentralized means for stakeholders to coordinate and interact within the Drey Finance ecosystem, driving its growth and ensuring its long-term sustainability.
