# Overview

Drey Finance is a blockchain-powered income platform for the 21st century that provides Bitcoin income for life through our decentralized actuarial operating system and artificial intelligence (AI) integrations. Our innovative solution addresses the shortcomings of traditional annuities and pensions, such as low interest rates, inflationary fiat payments, opaque solvency issues, and the lack of transparency that hinders effective retirement planning. By 2050, the public pension funding gap is projected to reach $400 trillion, demonstrating the urgent need for alternative retirement solutions.

Our platform combines the pooling of gifted mortality-based life credits used within classical style [tontines](../docs/drey-fund-primer.md), with the growth and income potential of digital assets, delivering stable high income returns in Bitcoin. Drey's income and retirement plans for individuals, couples, and families eliminate longevity risk, underfunding risk, and inflationary risk.

1. Monthly distributions in BTC over the [Lightning Network](https://trustmachines.co/learn/what-is-lightning-network/), convertible to fiat on distribution
2. Transparent and auditable off-chain smart contracts secured by [zero-knowledge proofs](https://www.horizen.io/academy/zero-knowledge-proofs-zkp/) (powered by [zkWASM](https://github.com/DelphinusLab/zkWasm) and [bitcoin recursive inscriptions](https://protos.com/what-are-recursive-inscriptions-on-bitcoin/)) ensure correct distribution allocations
3. Low-cost setup and administration fees compared to traditional financial products
