# Token Journey

The DREY token journey begins with its acquisition by various stakeholders, including Drey Fund Investors, Drey Actuaries, and liquidity providers. Investors seeking exposure to bitcoin life-pooling protocol returns can acquire DREY tokens through exchanges, initial offerings, or other distribution events. Drey Actuaries and liquidity providers may receive DREY tokens as rewards for their contributions to the ecosystem and to bootstrap participation. This initial phase highlights how the different stakeholders can acquire tokens and gain access to the Drey Finance ecosystem.

Once stakeholders have acquired DREY tokens, they can use them to participate in the core functions of the ecosystem. Investors can utilise their tokens to gain access to other investment opportunities in the Drey Funds, while Drey Actuaries can stake their tokens as collateral to participate in the protocol and earn a share of the protocol's revenue. Liquidity providers can also employ their tokens in yield farming strategies, further enhancing their returns and benefiting from the growth of the platform.

As stakeholders become more deeply involved in the Drey Finance ecosystem, they may transition into new roles or levels of engagement. For example, an investor who initially acquired DREY tokens for investment purposes may eventually choose to become a liquidity provider, leveraging their tokens to earn additional rewards. This flexibility allows stakeholders to adapt their token journey according to their evolving interests and needs.

In addition to utilising the DREY token for investment and yield generation purposes, stakeholders can also participate in the decentralised governance of the platform. By holding and staking DREY tokens, users could acquire voting rights proportional to their holdings, allowing them to influence the direction of the protocol. This enables stakeholders to take an active role in shaping the future of the ecosystem, ensuring its continued growth and development.

The DREY token journey can be visualised as a funnel, with various levels of engagement and corresponding conversion and churn rates. Some stakeholders may choose to remain passive participants, while others may become deeply involved in the ecosystem's operations and governance. By understanding the token journey of its key stakeholders, the Drey Finance team can identify potential points of friction and optimize the user experience, ensuring a seamless and rewarding experience for all participants in the network.
